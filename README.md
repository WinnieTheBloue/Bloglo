# Bloglo - My personal space 🚀

Welcome to my personal space, Bloglo. I'm thrilled to have you here! 👋

## About me 🧑‍💻

I am a web application development enthusiast and media engineering student. Bloglo is my space to share my knowledge, experiences, and thoughts on various topics that captivate me. Here, you'll find a variety of content ranging from web development to personal reflections.

## Technology stack 📚

This project is built with the following technologies:

- Hugo - A fast and modern static site generator
- Markdown - For writing content easily
- Ananke - A theme for Hugo

## Code structure 🗂

- `content/`: Contains all the blog posts written in Markdown.
- `themes/`: Holds the themes used in the blog, including the Ananke theme.
- `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.

## Deployment process 🚀

This blog is automatically deployed using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The `deploy.yml` workflow in the `.github/workflows/` directory handles the deployment process.

## Acknowledgments 🎉
